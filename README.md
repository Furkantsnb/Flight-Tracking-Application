# Flight-Tracking-Application

![ağ projesi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8644e3a-a493-4f3c-a66c-3ab614c66fac)

In the app.py file, we fetch the data for our project from the OpenSky Network API and obtain a dynamic world map.

In the app2.py file, we fetch the data from a .csv file and present the project as two static world maps. The first map displays the speed values as a Rainbow visualization on the world map, while the second map shows the source countries and the current positions of the airplanes as routes between them, thus completing our project.

The tum_dunya.csv file contains 4500 data points fetched dynamically from the OpenSky API. We used this dataset in our static file.

(By utilizing both dynamic data (API) and static data, we successfully implemented our project using two different approaches.)
